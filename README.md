# Known Issues and Areas for Improvement

- **API Calls - Error Message**: Need to create Response (Error) messages for all API calls. Currently, the Response (Error) is only programmed for some calls.
- **Petsitter Login - JWT:** Need to ensure the JWT authentication is working. It's working for owner login, but not always with petsitter login. We've noted the appropriate Response (Success) to the request in the API documentation but it needs to be fixed in the code.
