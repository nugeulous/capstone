# Known Issues and Future Enhancements

- **API Error Handling**: Implement more thorough error handling for all API calls. Currently, error responses are only created for a subset of API interactions.
- **Data Formatting**: Standardize all data formatting to use camelCase. Some fields are still using snake_case.
- **Logout Confirmation**: Add a confirmation page to confirm successful logout and improve the user experience.
- **Booking Time Granularity**: Enhance the booking service by adding more detailed start time, end time, and date options to improve flexibility.
- **HTML Optimization**: Refactor HTML to replace IDs with classes for improved scalability and maintainability.
- **Redux Implementation**: Expand the use of Redux throughout the entire application; currently, it is only implemented in the booking flow.
